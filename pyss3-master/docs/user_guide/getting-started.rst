Getting Started
***************

Don't know where to start? don't worry!

1. (Optional) Take a look at :ref:`ss3-classifier` page to have a general idea of how the classifier works. We recommend reading, at least, the :ref:`ss3-introduction` and the :ref:`ss3-hyperparameter` section but if you get bored just ignore this step.
2. Do at least one of the :ref:`tutorials`.

Once you are done with these two steps, you will have a general knowledge of how to work with PySS3 :)

Finally, for specific topics you can read any of the following items.
